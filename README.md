# math-exam-generator
#### Overview
This is my implementation of an exercise project from
Build To Win: Effective Software Engineering(ISBN 978-7-115-46076-9),
Chapter 1. It can randomly generate primary school level calculation
exercises into a PDF file with a variety of options.
#### Features
1. Can generate +, -, *, / calculation exercises with both integers and
fractions.
2. Allow generating an answer sheet along with the exam paper.
3. Allow expressions with more than one operands.
4. Can use brackets to generate more complex exercises.
5. Allow interactively taking tests via command line, with a timer and
a score report. (emmm...I guess nobody would do that)
6. English and Chinese language support.
